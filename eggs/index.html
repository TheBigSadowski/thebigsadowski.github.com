<h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
<p>I'd love to work with all of you over at Good Eggs. We should talk!</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I'm a developer that's been working with node.js most recently and I'm a huge fan of what you've built so far. In the past, I've done a lot of work around using technology to help small businesses. Most recently I've been developing with Node.js and I think we could build some amazing things together.</p>

<p>I believe there are no best practices, only <em>better</em> practices. I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship things (usually pretty early). This has allowed me to deliver lots of amazing products and features, making customers happy and then immediately start work on making them even better.</p>

<p>After about 4 years inside larger organizations, I'm craving the excitement that can only be found in early stage companies like yours and I'm looking for a way that I can do more than just write code. I want to have a real impact on how the world works and I think Good Eggs might be one of the few places I could make a positive change in the world.</p>

<h3>How I heard about Good Eggs:</h3>
<p>The other day, I was discussing the different software tools and services that exist for small local food producers with my friend Brian that runs the <a href="http://www.goodeggs.com/magiccurrykart">Magic Curry Kart</a>. The topic turned to online marketplaces where you could showcase your goods and he suggested I check out what you've been building. So, I did and I placed an order the next day. Everything worked perfectly and I was super happy with everything I ordered.<p>

<h2>About you:</h2>
<p>I think you've got the formula right. People are increasingly wanting to know how their food is produced and who is making it. You are one of the only groups that I've seen that makes this distinction and knows that showcasing the producers and their goods is one of the most important things in building a local food marketplace. To me, this is most visible in your producer profiles and how beautifully crafted they are.</p>

<p>You've also built the beginnings of a solid delivery business. As you grow and expand into new markets, that's going to require a lot of really interesting work to make it all operate smoothly and effectively. It sounds like a very interesting challenge to coordinate hundreds of local producers, shipments, pickups and deliveries, especially when freshness is one of the most important things your customers are looking for.</p>

<p>I've also had a bit of a look at the tools you offer the producers, and I'm pretty excited with some of the tools you've already built like direct marketing support as well as possibilities you could offer producers in the future, like more detailed customer analytics that could really change how local food businesses are run.</p>

<p>On top of this, your technology philosophy seems similar to mine. I love that your job posting asks for someone that wants to "grow" a software platform. I've often said that software development is much like gardening in that it's more about maintaining steady growth than big revolutionary changes. It hints that you know sustainability in the code is as important as sustainability in our food system.</p>

<h2>What I will bring to the table (ok, pun intended):</h2>
<p>I love using technology to help small to medium sized businesses (ideally local ones) to grow. This is part of the reason I joined CityVoter from the beginning and it was a large factor in why I worked with the team building Business Catalyst before (and after) it was acquired by Adobe. Both companies provided small businesses with tools to help them grow and more efficiently run their business.</p>

<p>I've been writing mission critical node.js code for a while now and have node code in production handling millions of requests per day.</p>

<p>I've been part of a very early stage company before, building things from the ground up. I know what it's like to have to work on all aspects of a system and honestly prefer the varied work that early stage companies with small teams have.</p>

<p>I'm no stranger to continuous delivery, TDD and other things that would fall under the software craftsmanship label. I've set up continuous delivery systems and the process to support them at 3 separate companies now.</p>

<p>I built most of the business profile management tools at CityVoter, empowering small local businesses to have more control over their presence on our sites and giving them ways to promote their business.</p>



<h2>My Food Experience - Making Pancakes with the Magic Curry Kart</h2>

<p>My food experience was humbling and left me with a much deeper respect for anyone running a food business. What I did was to join a friend of mine Brian who runs the <a href="http://www.goodeggs.com/magiccurrykart">Magic Curry Kart</a> in cooking and selling to random strangers at the intersection of 19th and Linda.</p>

<p>This got started after having Brian over for my yearly Super Pancake Fest. These take place the Friday after Thanksgiving each year and are a bit of a spectacle. I typically make about 5-6 different kinds of pancakes with triple chocolate or poppyseed being the usual favorites and maybe 10 or so toppings with spiced clementines or the home made apple sauce being some of the favorite sauces. Anyway, after this one Super Pancake Fest, a few years ago, Brian invited me out to sell pancakes with him on the street from his cart. I brushed it off at the time, but after a while, we decided to do it for real.</p>

<p>Since this was my first time selling food to strangers, I decided on a simplified menu. I prepared a plain pancake batter the night before and in the morning I prepared a mix of berries, some mint and a touch of sugar. I also brought along some real Vermont maple syrup (I know it's not local, but Vermont is really the only place that should legally be allowed to produce maple syrup) and powdered sugar.</p>

<p><img title="That's me in the black t-shirt cooking up some really delicious pancakes" alt="making pancakes on the street" src="mck-pancakes.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;"> The day of, we set up outside the Mission Pool on 19th by Linda. I had a small camp stove and griddle and Brian was making and selling breakfast sandwiches featuring his Magic Curry Paste from his "Kart". The setup worked pretty well and we were able to produce a lot of food pretty quickly.</p>

<p>However, what quickly became apparent is that pancakes are not really a mobile food. They're not designed to be eaten on the go. On top of this the only people that seemed to be into the pancakes were families with small children (kinda rare at the intersection we chose near Dolores park). At the end of the day, the breakfast sandwich had outsold the pancakes 4 to 1 or more.</p>

<p>So, what did I learn? While I learned that pancakes are logistically difficult on the street, the main thing I learned was just how difficult it is to be a small food vendor and that the people doing these things need our support. Since then, I've become a lot more conscious of where my food money is going and have tried to make sure it's supporting new and independent producers. I've also tried to support Brian and others like him whenever possible.</p>

<p>On top of all this, I learned that I personally get more enjoyment when I give away food that I make than when I sell it and I think that's why I haven't gone back to do this again. But overall, I'm glad I got to experience what it's like to go out there and sell food on the street and I now know on some level what a lot of the local producers are feeling and dealing with and am maybe just a bit more equipped to help them than I was before.</p>

<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and find out about me. I'd love to talk to you about working together. You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:joe.sadowski@gmail.com">joe.sadowski@gmail.com</a>. Together, I think we can make an amazing product even better and have a huge impact on the world.</p>

<!--
<p>In the past I've worked as a developer, architect, founder, tech lead and manager (sometimes all at the same time). I've worked at large companies like Adobe and Rakuten and have also built a business and development team from the ground up with 3 other co-founders.</p>

<p>These days, my passion lies in building blazingly fast teams that deliver amazing products. Here's a bit about who I am...</p>


<h3>I'm a nerd</h3>
<p>I'm a <em>huge</em> nerd. My wife teases me for reading books like Leading Lean Software Development, Domain Driven Design, or Implementation Patterns at night before bed and it really confuses her when I read something like Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies on a vacation for fun.</p>


<h3>I'm passionate about continuous improvement</h3>
<p>I believe there are no best practices, only <em>better</em> practices. I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship things (usually pretty early). This has allowed me to deliver lots of amazing products and features, making customers happy and then immediately start work on making them even better.</p>

<p>I view modern software development (especially on a service like Nextdoor) as a continuous flow of changes being streamed out to the users and have helped many teams to adopt this view of development and use it to make themselves faster and more reliable.</p>


<h3>I can make a damn fine cappuccino</h3>
<p>Seriously... and when I do, I always make an extra one to share because everyone loves random acts of cappuccino!</p>

<section class="you">
<h2>About you</h2>

<p>People are talking about what you are doing and you have a huge opportunity to not just make a great product, but really improve communities and build stronger ties between people that live near each other. You're trying to improve the lives of everyone on the planet and reverse the trend of people not even knowing their neighbors.</p>


<h3>You're on a roll</h3>
<p>You've built partnerships with many cities, towns and now even counties to help deliver police, fire and civic information faster. The platform you've built has helped to keep people safe, find lost pets and even send updates about new things. Major media outlets are starting to talk and you have a real chance to really improve the quality of life of the people that use your product.</p>


<h3>You have big goals</h3>
<p>You want to be the glue that brings neighbors together and you want to bring that experience to all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>Your mission isn't going to be easy. You are doing something that hasn't been done before and you need someone who isn't going to just apply pre-existing formulas or plug in processes that worked in the past. You need someone that is truly going to understand how Nextdoor is different and build teams, process and culture around this.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you are changing neighborhoods for the better and making a big impact in peoples lives. These are all things that I want to accomplish in my life and I feel positive we can do it together.</p>

<section class="past">
<h2>Why you might want me to work with you</h2>

<p>To save you from having to read through all of my past experience on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joesadowski">my resume</a>, here are a few highlights that I think you will find most relevant to what you are doing at Nextdoor...</p>

<h3>I've lead and mentored extremely high-performing lean/agile teams</h3>
<p>At Rakuten, not only was I able to set up processes and team structure in a way that increased team output by about 4x what it was perviously, but I was able to also teach people the benefits of many lean/agile techniques, leading to teams that self-improved constantly and really embraced concepts like automated testing and continuous deployment. The coolest part about this is that some of these people have moved to other teams and introduced the practices they learned to improve the way those teams work.</p>


<h3>I've built, run and maintained location based systems that deal specifically with neighborhoods</h3>
<p>At CityVoter, we ran best of contests to find the best local small businesses in cities and neighborhoods. Because of this, I've either personally developed or led the development of things that are probably very similar to parts of what you've built. For example, we needed to be able to define city and neighborhood boundaries and check to make sure businesses were within the boundaries. We solved this by building admin tools to draw the neighborhoods and other geographic boundaries and code to match the businesses location to that geography. We also needed to verify business ownership and chose to use a combination of ways similar to what you have done.</p>


<h3>I've built two extremely high performing agile development groups</h3>
<p>At both CityVoter and Rakuten, I've led and mentored teams in how to design a system and process to be fully confident in being able to deploy many times per day. At Rakuten, we were able to deliver new API level features to the team in Tokyo that was building the Japanese language version of the user interface and integrate their code back in every day. We used a kanban board to keep track of what stage the development of each feature was in and to be able to focus attention when things became stuck. All of this led to much faster delivery of features.</p>

<p>And at CityVoter, the team I built form the ground up still carries my personal best for number of successful no-outage releases to production in a single day... 26 times. I would love to beat that record at Nextdoor!</p>
