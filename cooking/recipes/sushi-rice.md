# Sushi Rice (with Rice Cooker)
Great tasting rice for all sorts of sushi.


## Special Tools
* Rice Cooker


## Ingredients (dressing)
* 3 Tbsp rice vinegar
* 3/4 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt


# Ingredients (rice)
If your rice cooker has a mode for sushi rice, use it and follow the direction for that. It should be a higher ratio of rice to water than regular white rice. If your rice cooker doesn't have settings for sushi rice, here's are substitute measurements for cooking the rice:

* 1 cup rice
* 1 1/4 cup water


## Steps

1. Follow rice cooker instructions for making the sushi rice
1. While rice is cooking, mix remaining ingredients until sugar and salt are totally disolved
1. Once rice is ready, remove it from the rice cooker, fluff it, and while stirring it, slowly mix in the dressing, making sure it's evenly coating all the rice


## Tips
* Prepare this ahead of time and let it sit in the rice cooker on "warm" as the dressing will infuse with the rice
