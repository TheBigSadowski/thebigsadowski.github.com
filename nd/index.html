<h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
<p>I'd love to work with all of you over at Nextdoor. We should talk!</p>

<section class="me">
<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My neighborhood on Nextdoor is <a href="https://westlowerhaight.nextdoor.com">West Lower Haight</a>.</p>

<p>In the past I've worked as a developer, architect, founder, tech lead and manager (sometimes all at the same time). I've worked at large companies like Adobe and Rakuten and have also built a business and development team from the ground up with 3 other co-founders.</p>

<p>These days, my passion lies in building blazingly fast teams that deliver amazing products. Here's a bit about who I am...</p>


<h3>I'm a nerd</h3>
<p>I'm a <em>huge</em> nerd. My wife teases me for reading books like Leading Lean Software Development, Domain Driven Design, or Implementation Patterns at night before bed and it really confuses her when I read something like Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies on a vacation for fun.</p>


<h3>I'm passionate about continuous improvement</h3>
<p>I believe there are no best practices, only <em>better</em> practices. I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship things (usually pretty early). This has allowed me to deliver lots of amazing products and features, making customers happy and then immediately start work on making them even better.</p>

<p>I view modern software development (especially on a service like Nextdoor) as a continuous flow of changes being streamed out to the users and have helped many teams to adopt this view of development and use it to make themselves faster and more reliable.</p>


<h3>I can make a damn fine cappuccino</h3>
<p>Seriously... and when I do, I always make an extra one to share because everyone loves random acts of cappuccino!</p>

<section class="you">
<h2>About you</h2>

<p>People are talking about what you are doing and you have a huge opportunity to not just make a great product, but really improve communities and build stronger ties between people that live near each other. You're trying to improve the lives of everyone on the planet and reverse the trend of people not even knowing their neighbors.</p>


<h3>You're on a roll</h3>
<p>You've built partnerships with many cities, towns and now even counties to help deliver police, fire and civic information faster. The platform you've built has helped to keep people safe, find lost pets and even send updates about new things. Major media outlets are starting to talk and you have a real chance to really improve the quality of life of the people that use your product.</p>


<h3>You have big goals</h3>
<p>You want to be the glue that brings neighbors together and you want to bring that experience to all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>Your mission isn't going to be easy. You are doing something that hasn't been done before and you need someone who isn't going to just apply pre-existing formulas or plug in processes that worked in the past. You need someone that is truly going to understand how Nextdoor is different and build teams, process and culture around this.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you are changing neighborhoods for the better and making a big impact in peoples lives. These are all things that I want to accomplish in my life and I feel positive we can do it together.</p>

<section class="past">
<h2>Why you might want me to work with you</h2>

<p>To save you from having to read through all of my past experience on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joesadowski">my resume</a>, here are a few highlights that I think you will find most relevant to what you are doing at Nextdoor...</p>

<h3>I've lead and mentored extremely high-performing lean/agile teams</h3>
<p>At Rakuten, not only was I able to set up processes and team structure in a way that increased team output by about 4x what it was perviously, but I was able to also teach people the benefits of many lean/agile techniques, leading to teams that self-improved constantly and really embraced concepts like automated testing and continuous deployment. The coolest part about this is that some of these people have moved to other teams and introduced the practices they learned to improve the way those teams work.</p>


<h3>I've built, run and maintained location based systems that deal specifically with neighborhoods</h3>
<p>At CityVoter, we ran best of contests to find the best local small businesses in cities and neighborhoods. Because of this, I've either personally developed or led the development of things that are probably very similar to parts of what you've built. For example, we needed to be able to define city and neighborhood boundaries and check to make sure businesses were within the boundaries. We solved this by building admin tools to draw the neighborhoods and other geographic boundaries and code to match the businesses location to that geography. We also needed to verify business ownership and chose to use a combination of ways similar to what you have done.</p>


<h3>I've built two extremely high performing agile development groups</h3>
<p>At both CityVoter and Rakuten, I've led and mentored teams in how to design a system and process to be fully confident in being able to deploy many times per day. At Rakuten, we were able to deliver new API level features to the team in Tokyo that was building the Japanese language version of the user interface and integrate their code back in every day. We used a kanban board to keep track of what stage the development of each feature was in and to be able to focus attention when things became stuck. All of this led to much faster delivery of features.</p>

<p>And at CityVoter, the team I built form the ground up still carries my personal best for number of successful no-outage releases to production in a single day... 26 times. I would love to beat that record at Nextdoor!</p>



<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and find out about me. I'd love to talk to you about working together. You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:joe.sadowski@gmail.com">joe.sadowski@gmail.com</a>. Together, I think we can make an amazing product even better and have a huge impact on the world.</p>
