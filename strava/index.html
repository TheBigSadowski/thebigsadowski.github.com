What’s next for Strava? Horvath mentioned a platform for coaching, gear recommendations, event and race discovery, and eventually content — maybe even coffee-table books — about where to ride and run. But what the company won’t do is expand to non-endurance activities like snow- and water sports.

<h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
<p>I'd love to work with all of you over at Strava. I build a <a href="#plugin">little plugin</a>. We should talk!</p>
</header>

<section class="me">
<h2>About me</h2>

<p>In the past I've worked as a developer, architect, founder, tech lead and manager (sometimes all at the same time). I've worked at large companies like Adobe and Rakuten and have also been essential to the growth of small startups including CityVoter that I founded with 3 co-founders.</p>

<p>These days, my passion lies in building super solid applications and services that scale massively. Here's a bit about who I am...</p>


<h3>I'm a nerd</h3>
<p>I'm a <em>huge</em> nerd. My wife teases me for reading books like Leading Lean Software Development, Domain Driven Design, or Implementation Patterns at night before bed and it really confuses her when I read something like Pro Git on a vacation for fun.</p>


<h3>I'm passionate about continuous improvement</h3>
<p>I believe there are no best practices, only <em>better</em> practices. I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship things (usually pretty early). This has allowed me to deliver lots of amazing products and features, making customers happy and then immediately start work on making them even better.</p>

<p>I view modern software development (especially on a service like Strava) as a continuous flow of changes being streamed out to the users and have helped many teams to adopt this view of development and use it to make themselves faster and more reliable.</p>


<h3>Strava's made a difference in my life</h3>
<p>One of the things I've missed most since moving to SF from Boston a few years ago is the group of friends that I used to ride with. Since joining Strava and connecting with them on your service, I've been able to rekindle that camaraderie through commenting on each others rides and kudos that we had even though we're thousands of miles apart. This has had the effect of getting me and my friends on our bikes more and making our lives healthier and richer.</p>

</section>


<section class="you">
<h2>About you</h2>

<p>You've created a product that resonates with athletes and in doing that, created what is probably the largest online community of cyclists. Every day, your users log millions of miles. And every day, your community and app are encouraging people to get out there and ride or run, but that's not enough for you. You want to provide more data, more recommendations and become even more essential as a tool to improve. You want to become even more indispensable to athletes and more useful to the casual user.</p>


<h3>You're on a roll</h3>
<p>MTBR calls Strava "THE killer app for cyclists". People are doing creative things with your app.</p>


<h3>You have big goals</h3>
<p>You want to be the #1 training tool for athletes and the authority for records. You have a solid install base of cyclists now, but you want to expand to other sports. To hit these goals, you're going to need to be flexible, adaptive and will need people that can change direction quickly with you.<p>


<h3>You're not content just providing individuals with training data</h3>
<p>You're thinking bigger and some of the <a href="http://app.strava.com/saturday-heatmap">things</a> Paul has done are evidence of that. You need someone that's not just going to build things to spec, but someone that's going to embrace, love and evolve the product with you.</p>


<h3>You're moving fast and want to move even faster</h3>
<p>I found this in your page source while writing this...</p>
<pre>
&lt;!--
deploy: strava-deploy/20130805-2
instance: i-7fb9691d
env: ec2
--&gt;
</pre>
<p>If I had to guess, I would say that means you released yesterday and that the version running is the second release for that day.<p>

<p>The bottom line is, you are building an amazing product and a passionate community. You need people to help make it even better and I would love to help you.</p>

<h2>Chrome Plugin for Strava</h2>
<p>To show how serious I am (and because I wanted some easier ways to discover new routes) I created a small plugin for chrome that adds things like nearby segments to your segment pages. You can install it from the Chorome Web Store or clone the source from GitHub and follow the directions in the readme to install it.</p>

<p><button onclick="chrome.webstore.install()" id="install-button">Add "Strava Hacks" to Chrome</button></p>
<script>
if (chrome.app.isInstalled) {
  document.getElementById('install-button').style.display = 'none';
}
</script>

<h2>Ideas to make Strava better</h2>

<p>These aren't really in any specific order, but here are a few things I would love to help out on...</p>

<p>Some of them I've started to build into a power tools plugin for chrome that adds some new features and navigation to the Strava web app. The code and install directions are up on <a href="https://github.com/TheBigSadowski/strava-nearby-segments-chrome">GitHub</a>, so check it out and let me know what you think!<p>

<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>When searching for something like <a href="">paradise loop sf</a> I don't see Strava's paradise loop page on the top 10. I think this could be due to </p>
	
	
<h3>Segment and route discovery</h3>
<p>I put some of my ideas around this into the <a href="https://github.com/TheBigSadowski/strava-nearby-segments-chrome">chrome plugin</a> I talk about above. It adds a small section to the right side navigation on segment pages that lets you jump to other segments that are nearby. It also changes how the "Explore" tab works, to take you to a segment explore page that is focused on the area around the segment you were looking at.</p>

<p>Ideally, this could also be something more like "people that rode this segment also rode these segments" or with stared segments, we could find people with similar tastes and use that information to suggest new routes for people.</p>


<h3>Percentile data</h3>
<p>Since I'm not the world's fastest (yet!), it would be interesting to see what percentile I am in as compared to other riders and be able to trend this over time. This comparison could be on a segment by segment level. It could just be a note next to each segment that you ride, telling you what percentile you are in. For example, If I had the 1208th fastest time out of 6023 riders on a segment, I would be in the 79% percentile.</p>

<p>You could take this even further and give each rider an overall percentile based on all the segments they have ridden. This could really encourage people to get out there and strive for personal improvement.</p>


<h3>Reopen the API</h3>
<p>I know your community is asking for this. I just think it would be awesome to work on. I'd love to see what people can do with the tools and data you could provide.</p>

<section class="past">
<h2>Why you might want me to work with you</h2>

<p>To save you from having to read through all of my past experience on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joesadowski">my resume</a>, here are a few highlights that I think you will find most relevant to what you are doing at Strava...</p>

<h3>I've scaled large apps before</h3>
<p>While working on the Business Catalyst team (before and after Adobe acquired us), I reworked, tuned and rebuilt (when needed) the more performance critical parts of the system to allow us to scale from a few thousand hosted websites up to over 30 thousand paying websites running on our platform. This comprised of profiling application, database and cache level components and tuning them to be sometimes 400x more performant.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this was when our blogging engine hit a wall. At the time, <a href="http://jessicawatson.com.au/index.htm">Jessica Watson</a> was using our platform to write about her experiences while setting the world record for the youngest person to sail around the world alone. This was heavily publicized in the Australia media and and drove massive (and unexpected) amounts of traffic to the blogging engine. Enough to take our services offline in Australia at times. To fix this, I went to work profiling the code, reworking the database schemas and indexes and moving as much of the content to pre-rendered chunks and storing them in memcache as possible. This resulted in us being able to handle over 400 times the traffic to our blogging engine and I'm proud to say there has been no need for future performance tuning on Blogs.</p>


<h3>I've built, run and maintained location based systems that deal specifically with neighborhoods</h3>
<p>At CityVoter, we ran best of contests to find the best local small businesses in cities and neighborhoods. Because of this, I've either personally developed or led the development of things that are probably very similar to parts of what you've built. For example, we needed to be able to define city and neighborhood boundaries and check to make sure businesses were within the boundaries. We solved this by building admin tools to draw the neighborhoods and other geographic boundaries and code to match the businesses location to that geography. We also needed to verify business ownership and chose to use a combination of ways similar to what you have done.</p>


<h3>I've built two extremely high performing agile development groups</h3>
<p>At both CityVoter and Rakuten, I've led and mentored teams in how to design a system and process to be fully confident in being able to deploy many times per day. At Rakuten, we were able to deliver new API level features to the team in Tokyo that was building the Japanese language version of the user interface and integrate their code back in every day. We used a kanban board to keep track of what stage the development of each feature was in and to be able to focus attention when things became stuck. All of this led to much faster delivery of features.</p>

<p>And at CityVoter, we were able to build our code and develop our process in a way that would allow us to release many times a day without any downtime. This team still carries my personal best for number of successful no-outage releases to production in a single day... 26 times. I would love to beat that record at Strava!</p>



<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and find out about me. I'd love to talk to you about working together. You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:joe.sadowski@gmail.com">joe.sadowski@gmail.com</a>. Together, I think we can make an amazing product even better and have a huge impact on the world.</p>
