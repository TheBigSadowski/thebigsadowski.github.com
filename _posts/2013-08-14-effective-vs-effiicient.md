On any project, there are two main attributes you want the team to have. You want them to be effective and to be efficient.



I believe the key to success on any project team is being effective and efficient.  I see effectiveness as accomplishing the right things and I see efficiency as being able to do things quickly or with little effort. If you are effective but not efficient, you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it might take you a long time. If you are efficient but not effective, you will get somewhere fast, but it might not be the right place and you might have to retrace your steps. As with anything in life, it's a balance.
