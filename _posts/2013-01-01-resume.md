title: Joe Sadowski - Resume
---
My passion to create not just great products, but truly amazing and innovative product development processes and teams has led my professional development. A tinkerer, explorer and builder by nature, I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship (usually pretty early). Because of this I typically work with companies and teams that move very fast where and are creating products that have never been done before.

Most of the products I work on are never "done". They are never "finished". Instead, day by day, release by release they become faster, more usable, more powerful and richer in features, getting value into our customer's hands and smiles on their faces sooner.
Experience

## Senior Architect - Rakuten LinkShare Corporation
### 2011 - 2013
Responsible for the overall technical quality of the new global marketing platform as well as organizing the work for a large development team of nearly 30 spread across the US, Japan and China.

#### While at Rakuten Marketing I:
* introduced scrum to the team and used it as the foundation for being able to predict project completion
* established (and continued to refine) the project scope with product owners and other subject matter experts (through story writing and refinement)
* collaborated with architects, developers, testers and dbas to define architectures that would make delivering the product faster and result in a better product
* later transitioned the team to kanban style project management when we needed to work more closely with the Japanese team (a sister company) that was building the Japanese user interface
* mentored the development team on iterative development and user focused development
* managed the workload for the offshore development team
* adapted our organizational structure (and hired people) to increase delivery


## Adobe Systems - Computer Scientist
### September 2009 - February 2011
After Business Catalyst was acquired by Adobe I've stayed on to help the team take what is now referred to as the Business Catalyst Platform to the next level. This mostly consisted of training up the new developers that Adobe assigned to the platform and helping to select technologies and approaches that would result in faster delivery and a better product.

#### Highlights:
* Provided technical guidance to the product owners, reducing time to implement and resulting in a better product
* Large (400x) performance improvements on key product features like blogs
* Guided the development teams in practices that helped make the product easier to maintain and enhance, resulting in faster delivery and less risky deployments

## Business Catalyst - Web Development Ninja
### April 2009 - August 2009 (acquired by Adobe)
In the short period between when I joined BC and when we were acquired by Adobe, I focused mostly on incremental improvements to the platform and keeping our more than 10,000 customer sites running flawlessly.

#### While in this role:
* significantly reduced the risk to deploy the application by introducing continuous integration, automated testing and database version control
* mentored some of the more junior developers in things like test driven development, object oriented design and building maintainable software (things you would refer to as software craftsmanship now)


## CityVoter - Co-founder & Chief Architect
### July 2006 - February 2009
As the 4th employee and one of 4 founders, I did everything from writing the first lines of code that eventually turend into our platform and launching (and re-launching) our first products to building out the product development team and nurturing our strong rapid results culture.

#### While I was with CityVoter:
* our record for release in a single day was 26
* we completely rebranded cityvoter.com and relaunched it (in about a week)
* we delivered 4 new products (city contest platform, cityvoter.com, guides & questions)


## Jenzabar - Senior Software Engineer
### 2004 – 2006
One of the lead developers on the JICS educational portal. My focus here was mostly on building solid frameworks and components for the other developers to use as well as establishing some common development patterns for the application to make it easier to build and maintain.

#### While I was at Jenzabar:
* We built and shipped the first major version of JICS on time
* I designed and developed large areas of the portal software (portlet runtime, common UI controls & data access)
* I lead the shift from markup heavy pages to css based style (also opening the door for our customers to heavily customize our user interface)


## Concentra - Software Engineer
### 2001 – 2004
Designed, built and maintained systems to import historical medical billing data for use in medical bill review software, giving the company the ability to flag duplicate bills for new clients. I ended up building tools and automating a lot of this and now most of the import process no longer needs a developer to assist.
