I'm a developer that's interested in building things that make the world a better place. I've worked at huge software companies like Adobe and Rakuten and I built CityVoter from the ground up with the help of 3 other co-founders. Most recently, I'm totally into node.js and all the amazing projects developing in the node community. A tinkerer, explorer and builder by nature, I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship (usually pretty early).


## Rakuten - Senior Architect <span>2011 - 2013</span>

Working as both a developer and manager at the same time, I was responsible for the overall technical quality of the new global marketing platform and organizing the work for a large development team of nearly 30 spread across the US, Japan and China while contributing code daily.

Technologies: node.js, oracle, mysql, php, perl, .net, aws, azure

* Designed and built most of the front-end ad serving and user tracking code
* Introduced scrum to the team and used it as the foundation for being able to predict project completion
* Established (and continued to refine) the project scope with product owners and other subject matter experts (through story writing and refinement)
* Collaborated with architects, developers, testers and dbas to define architectures that would make delivering the product faster and result in a better product
* Later transitioned the team to kanban style project management when we needed to work more closely with the Japanese team (a sister company) that was building the Japanese user interface
* Mentored the development team on iterative development and user focused development
* Managed the workload for the offshore development team
* Adapted our organizational structure (and hired people) to increase delivery
* Jumped on the grenade that was hurricane Sandy taking out our main data center in lower Manhattan by coordinating recovery efforts and taking responsibility for recovering some of the systems directly


## Adobe - Computer Scientist <span>2009 - 2011</span>

After Business Catalyst was acquired by Adobe I've stayed on to help the team take what is now referred to as the Business Catalyst Platform to the next level. This mostly consisted of day to day development, training up the new developers that Adobe assigned to the platform and helping to select technologies and approaches that would result in faster delivery and a better product.

Technologies: .net (C#), SQL Server

* Rebuilt the blogging engine (in crisis mode) to handle 400x the load through more intelligent caching and better data access
* Provided technical guidance to the product owners, reducing time to implement and resulting in a better product
* Reworked large portions of the system so that our customer sites would have higher search engine rankings through things like URL slugs and providing alternatives to content that was previously only available via AJAX calls
* Guided the development teams in practices that helped make the product easier to maintain and enhance, resulting in faster delivery and less risky deployments


## Business Catalyst - Web Ninja <span>April - August 2009 (acquired by Adobe)</span>

In the short period between when I joined BC and when we were acquired by Adobe, I focused mostly on incremental improvements to the platform and keeping our more than 10,000 customer sites running flawlessly.

Technologies: .net (C#), SQL Server

* Rebuilt the shipping quote system to give correct quotes and allow for more providers to be added
* Significantly reduced the risk to deploy the application by introducing continuous integration, automated testing and database version control
* Mentored more junior developers in things like test driven development, object oriented design and building maintainable software (things you would refer to as software craftsmanship now)


## CityVoter - Co-founder & Chief Architect <span>2006 - 2009</span>

As the 4th employee and one of 4 founders, I did everything from writing the first lines of code that eventually turned into our platform and launching (and re-launching) our first products to building out the product development team and nurturing our strong rapid results culture.

Technologies: .net (C#), SQL Server

* Designed and built nearly all technology in use at CityVoter
* We completely rebranded cityvoter.com and relaunched it (in about a week)
* We delivered 4 new products (city contest platform, cityvoter.com, guides & questions)
* Built a small development team who's record for releases in a single day was 26
* Saved the world countless times


## Jenzabar - Senior Software Engineer <span>2004 - 2006</span>

One of the lead developers on the JICS educational portal. My focus here was mostly on building solid frameworks and components for the other developers to use as well as establishing some common development patterns for the application to make it easier to build and maintain.

Technologies: .net (C#), SQL Server

* We built and shipped the first major version of JICS on time
* I designed and developed large areas of the portal software (portlet runtime, common UI controls & data access)
* I build several portlets (file manager, custom content, etc.)
* I led the shift from markup heavy pages to css based style (also opening the door for our customers to heavily customize our user interface)


## Concentra - Software Engineer <span>2001 - 2004</span>

Technologies: oracle, bash, perl, .net

Designed, built and maintained systems to import historical medical billing data for use in medical bill review software, giving the company the ability to flag duplicate bills for new clients. I ended up building tools and automating a lot of this and now most of the import process no longer needs a developer to assist.

* Automated the historical medical bill data imports, saving a lot of time, headaches and money
* Developed core reusable components for other developers to quickly build applications that work on data coming out of our medical bill scanning centers
