# Hello TypeKit Team,

I'm a developer that's worked at Adobe before (on the Business Catalyst team). I'm pretty excited about what you are doing and would like to talk to you about the possibility of working together to make the web a more typographically rich place.


## Why I think TypeKit is awesome
I love that you're empowering web designers to be more expressive and are making the web a richer, more beautiful place. You've figured out how to make custom web fonts easy for nearly anyone building web content to use, empowering people that have previously not been able to reach this level of richness in web content. And in doing all this, you've built tools to efficiently deliver the fonts, having the least impact on load times and user experience.

I've also done some research on your team with people I've worked with in the past and I've only heard good things. One person described your team as "what Business Catalyst was like in the early days, they often go out together and are a tight bunch." I think that's pretty cool since I know how hard it can been to keep a strong team bond after the acquisition.


## How I can help you make TypeKit even better
Typography and fonts have always been something that has interested me. Yes, I'm a developer, but I know and care about things like kerning, ligatures and understand that type selection can vastly impact readability and influence the tone of writing.

In addition to an understanding of and love for good typography...

* I know how the web works. I know not just html, javascript and css, but the details of http, dns and tcp that are important for a service like TypeKit. For example: I can format http requests and responses by hand, I know the difference between chunked and non-chunked encoding, I think PATCH is cool (and I think it's good that it's now the default rails behavior) and my favorite http response code is 418.
* Most recently I've been working on ad servers at Rakuten that serve around 100M ads per day, so I understand the needs of something like TypeKit that is used on hundreds of thousands of very popular sites and accessed from every corner of the world.
* I have a deep understanding of your main target audience thought my work on Business Catalyst and can use that to help you make TypeKit even more powerful.
* I've built globally deployed cloud systems for the last 2 years and I understand how to design for and support this environment.
* I've been through an Adobe acquisition before. I have some idea of what you have gone through and know how to be effective in your environment.


## Finally
I think TypeKit is pretty cool,  I've heard great things about the team and have some solid experience to contribute. I'd love to talk more to see if there is a fit so we can make TypeKit (and therefore the hundreds of thousands of sites using it) even better together.

Thanks for your time,
