<p>My passion to create not just great products, but truly amazing and innovative product development processes and teams has led my professional development. A tinkerer, explorer and builder by nature, I&#8217;m never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship (usually pretty early). Because of this I typically work with companies and teams that move very fast where and are creating products that have never been done before.</p>

<p>Most of the products I work on are never &#8220;done&#8221;. They are never &#8220;finished&#8221;. Instead, day by day, release by release they become faster, more usable, more powerful and richer in features, getting value into our customer&#8217;s hands and smiles on their faces sooner.</p>

<p>After Business Catalyst was acquired by Adobe I&#8217;ve stayed on to help the team take what is now referred to as the Business Catalyst Platform to the next level.
