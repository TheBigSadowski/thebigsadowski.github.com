<h2>Square/Block <span>2015+</h2>

<p>At Square (now Block) I was at the center of the move to the cloud. My role was to first make it possible to use the cloud, then build trust and design an organizational architecture that will last, and finally to make a mass migration of all Square services to the new platform in AWS.</p>

<h3>Product Manager: Cloud Platform</h3>

<p>Lead product manager for Square's internal cloud platform and an organization of ~100 engineers, serving an internal audience of ~2000 application engineers, primarily focusing on our migration of ~800 microservices to AWS by replatforming from home-grown tooling to AWS hosted services (EKS, MySQL Aurora, ElastiCache, etc.).</p>

<ul>
<li>Drove per app migration times from 3 months per app to ~2 weeks and apps moved per week from &lt;1 to ~15 per week</li>

<li>Owned the roadmap for how to reach feature parity with the data center and what migration tooling/automation needed to be built</li>

<li>Managed relationships with application owners across all of Square to make sure the new platform and migration process would meet their needs</li>

<li>Led annual and quarterly planning for an organization of over 100 engineers</li>

</ul>

<h3>Engineering Manager: Cloud Foundations</h3>

<p>Managed a team of 9 mostly senior engineers and built the foundation for how Square will use AWS. We focused first on making it possible and safe to use the cloud to extend on-prem applications and then to building fully AWS based apps. We measured success by the percent of new applications created in the data center vs AWS and also by developer satisfaction scores in surveys comparing our cloud platform to our on-prem platform.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developed a multi-account strategy (one AWS account per application per environment) and automated new application provisioning to give developers maximum flexibility of AWS and minimize blast radius between applications. We now have over 6000 small, focused AWS accounts.</li>

<li>Saved over $100M in cloud costs by negotiating AWS and GCP contracts (including the first ones at Square)</li>

<li>Reached 90%+ infrastructure as code coverage in production environments by developing Terraform tooling and modules to make it easy to discover and quickly deploy "golden path" application architectures</li>

<li>Shifted focus from a multi-cloud (GCP and AWS) strategy that we could not support with the allowed headcount to an AWS first strategy, allowing us to build a much better platform and developer experience, while reducing development costs</li>

<li>Ran the cloud cost-savings program, cutting millions from our AWS and GCP bills</li>

<li>Developed a combined cloud roadmap with peer teams (databases, traffic, networking, compute, etc.) to make it possible to use AWS as an extension of our data center, setting the stage for migration</li>

<li>Unblocked use of AWS Lambda as an alternative compute platform that made it possible for Lambda based applications to interact with services in the data center or EKS via our Envoy service mesh, resulting in dozens of low-cost, easy to maintain applications</li>

<li>Top interviewer for hiring EMs</li>

<li>Held bi-monthly career development conversions with my reports, resulting in 2 promotions (one to a staff level)</li>

</ul>


<h3>Engineering Manager: Caviar Cloud Platform</h3>

<p>Led a team of 4 engineers focusing on making the 4 other engineering teams more productive and Caviar as a whole more stable. We blended SRE and platform development and served as guides on breaking down the Ruby monolith.</p>

<ul>
<li>Migrated Caviar systems from Heroku to AWS</li>

<li>Improved service reliability and incident resolution times by migrating metrics, logs, APM to DataDog, training the other teams on these tools, running game-days (called "oncallapalooza") and driving clearer team ownership through separate monolith deployments, per team database replicas, and breaking down the shared oncall rotation.</li>

<li>Reduced time to market by reducing flakey test impact, improving parallelization of test runs and providing a web interface for deploys to production (staging deploys were automatic)</li>

<li>Started the "cloud sync" to connect developers interested in cloud across Square and to grow interest in cloud computing at a data center focused company</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technical Lead - Good Eggs <span>2013 - 2015</h2>

<p>Focusing on the shopping experience, my role here blended product management, software engineering, project management and engineering leadership. Our primary goals were to increase conversion rate for orders placed, increase retention, and optimize ordering for efficient delivery.</p>

<ul>
<li>Led the rebuild of the shopping site resulting in significant increases in revenue</li>

<li>Increased conversion rates 20%</li>

<li>Reduced average lost revenue per order for unavailable products from over $5 to less than $0.60</li>

<li>Designed and led the development of our first shopping APIs for the iOS app</li>

<li>Introduced more metrics driven decision making and started groups to exchange learning about our metrics</li>

<li>Directly managed 5 developers (though many times was leading teams of 15 or more)</li>

<li>Reversed the technical debt accumulation introduced the "Garbanzo Strong" program where developers could earn bracelets for major cleanup work in our most nasty legacy codebase</li>
</ul>



<h2>Senior Architect &amp; Engineering Manager - Rakuten LinkShare Corporation <span>2011 - 2013</h2>

<p>Responsible for the overall technical quality of the new global marketing platform as well as organizing the work for a large development team of nearly 30 spread across the US, Japan and China while contributing code daily.</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduced scrum to the team and used it as the foundation for being able to predict project completion</li>

<li>Established (and continued to refine) the project scope with product owners and other subject matter experts (through story writing and refinement)</li>

<li>Led architects, developers, testers and dbas to define architectures that would make delivering the product faster and result in a better product</li>

<li>Transitioned the team to kanban style project management when we needed to work more closely with the Japanese team (a sister company) that was building the Japanese user interface</li>

<li>Mentored the development team on iterative development and user focused development</li>

<li>Managed the workload for the offshore development &amp; QA teams</li>

<li>Adapted our organizational structure (and hired people) to increase delivery</li>

<li>Directly managed 3 engineers</li>
</ul>


<h2 id='adobe_systems__computer_scientist'>Adobe Systems - Computer Scientist <span>2009 - 2011</span></h2>

<p>After Business Catalyst was acquired by Adobe I stayed on to help the team take what is now referred to as the Business Catalyst Platform to the next level. This mostly consisted of day to day development, training up the new developers that Adobe assigned to the platform and helping to select technologies and approaches that would result in faster delivery and a better product.</p>

<h4 id='highlights'>Highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Provided technical guidance to the product owners, reducing time to implement and resulting in a better product</li>

<li>Large (400x) performance improvements on key product features like blogs</li>

<li>Guided the development teams in practices that helped make the product easier to maintain and enhance, resulting in faster delivery and less risky deployments</li>

<li>Significantly reduced the risk to deploy the application by introducing continuous integration, automated testing and database version control</li>

</ul>


<h2 id='cityvoter__cofounder__chief_architect'>CityVoter - Co-founder &amp; Chief Architect <span>2006 - 2009</span></h2>

<p>As the 4th employee and one of 4 founders, I did everything from writing the first lines of code that eventually turned into our platform, to launching (and re-launching) our first products, to building out the product development team and nurturing our strong rapid results culture.</p>

<ul>
<li>I grew the product organization from 2 people to 6</li>

<li>Our record for releases in a single day was 26</li>

<ul>
<li>We built and shipped the first major version of JICS on time</li>

<li>I designed and developed large areas of the portal software (portlet runtime, common UI controls &amp; data access)</li>

<li>I lead the shift from markup heavy pages to css based style (also opening the door for our customers to heavily customize our user interface)</li>
</ul>
