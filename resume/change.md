growth questions:
 - what are the most iportant growth metrics?
   - number of active petitions?
   - number of signatures per week/month? (unique signers)
   - sponsored petitions?
   - revenue

growth ideas
 - widgets for other sites, collect signature from your blog
 - better listing of related petitions on the petition page... I'm seeing the same ones all the time
   - other petitions from the same organization
 - add a local aspect to petitions. I want to see ones around me (maybe here: https://www.change.org/petitions)
 - translations for petitions... lots of them are global petitions and could benefit from being in more than one language



wacky:
 - contests for best petition
 - allow donations to organizations
