<p>I'd love to work with all of you over at Lookout. We should talk!</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>In the past I've worked as a developer, architect, founder, tech lead, project manager and functional manager (sometimes all at the same time). I've worked at large companies like Adobe and Rakuten and have also built a business and development team from the ground up with 3 other co-founders.</p>

<p>These days, my passion lies in building blazingly fast teams and delivery pipelines that produce amazing products. Here's a bit about who I am...</p>


<h3>I'm a nerd</h3>
<p>I'm a <em>huge</em> nerd. My wife teases me for reading books like Leading Lean Software Development, Domain Driven Design, or Implementation Patterns at night before bed and it really confuses her when I read something like Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies on a vacation for fun.</p>


<h3>I'm passionate about continuous improvement</h3>
<p>I believe there are no best practices, only <em>better</em> practices. I'm never satisfied with good enough, but I know when to draw the line and ship things (usually pretty early). This has allowed me to deliver lots of amazing products and features, making customers happy and then immediately start work on making them even better.</p>

<p>I view modern software development as a continuous flow of changes being streamed out to the users and have helped many teams to adopt this view of development and use it to make themselves faster and more reliable.</p>

<h2>About you</h2>

<p>You are the leader in mobile security and you're trying to make mobile computing safer for everyone. You all rock cool hoodies, and apparently only eat waffles. (Seriously, every other <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/lookout-mobile-security-hq/4f0b2563e4b0671f2a59b384/photos">picture at Lookout on FourSquare</a> is of a waffle!). You build products and services to keep people safe on mobile devices.</p>

<h3>But, It's not just about the product for you</h3>
<p>Through your blog and other channels, you're helping to educate people on mobile security, making everyone safer. You're on a mission and </p>


<h3>You have big goals</h3>
<p>Your mission isn't going to be easy. You are doing something that hasn't been done before and you need someone who isn't going to just apply pre-existing formulas or plug in processes that worked in the past. You need someone that is truly going to understand how Lookout is different and build teams, process and culture around this.</p>

You also read the hidden text!
And you know that you need to look deeper than the surface to find the root problems and address them.

<h3>You're growing</h3>
<p>Right now, I can see 21 open positions in the engineering department alone. The process you have today might not be the process you need tomorrow. You're going to need someone that's going to be able to see that shift when it happens and react to it.</p>


<h3>You're people are special</h3>

<h2>Why you might want me to work with you</h2>

<p>To save you from having to read through all of my past experience on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joesadowski">my resume</a>, here are a few highlights that I think you will find most relevant to what you are doing at Lookout...</p>

<h3>I've lead, mentored and managed extremely high-performing lean/agile teams</h3>
<p>At Rakuten, not only was I able to set up processes and team structure in a way that increased team output by about 4x what it was perviously, but I was able to also teach people the benefits of many lean/agile techniques, leading to teams that self-improved constantly and really embraced concepts like automated testing and continuous deployment. The coolest part about this is that some of these people have moved to other teams and introduced the practices they learned to improve the way those teams work.</p>


<h3>Security has always been a huge concern of mine</h3>
<p>While developing ad servers for Rakuten, I asked the team to take a week off from the normal development cycle and to focus on security as well as performance. We did this by asking the team to break into two groups. One would attack the system, trying to overload or otherwise break it, and the other would try to quickly react to the attacks and patch the system to foil the attack. If the attackers could take down the service for more than 5 minutes a day (as monitored by pingdom) they would win the day, if the service had less than 5 minutes of downtime, the defenders would win. The outcome was that the teams had a blast fighting it out, learned new techniques for both attacking and defending our services and we were able to harden the system from attacks and prove the amount of traffic we can handle at the same time.</p>

<p>If you're curious about some of the details, one of the developers wrote up how he was able to <a href="http://blog.ehuna.org/2012/04/how_to_stop_a_denial_of_servic.html">implement some of the defenses</a> on his blog.</p>


<h3>I've built two extremely high performing agile development groups</h3>
<p>At both CityVoter and Rakuten, I've led and mentored teams in how to design a system and process to be fully confident in being able to deploy many times per day. At Rakuten, we were able to deliver new API level features to the team in Tokyo that was building the Japanese language version of the user interface and integrate their code back in every day. We used a kanban board to keep track of what stage the development of each feature was in and to be able to focus attention when things became stuck. All of this led to much faster delivery of features and an end to end knowledge of where we were at with the project that we didn't have before.</p>

<p>And at CityVoter, the team I built form the ground up still carries my personal best for number of successful no-outage releases to production in a single day... 26 times.</p>
